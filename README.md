Grammar is one of the main building blocks of language. Each human language, and
programming language for that matter, has a set of rules that every person speaking it has
to follow because otherwise, they risk not being understood. These grammatical rules can
be uncovered using NLP and are useful for extracting data from sentences. For example,
using information about the grammatical structure of text, we can parse out subjects,
objects, and relationships between different entities.
In this chapter, you will learn how to use different packages to reveal the grammatical
structure of words and sentences, as well as extract certain parts of sentences. We will
cover the following topics:
* Counting nouns – plural and singular nouns
* Getting the dependency parse
* Splitting sentences into clauses
* Extracting noun chunks
* Extracting entities and relations
* Extracting subjects and objects of the sentence
* Finding references – anaphora resolution
